# Universal-Controller-Script
A universal script to link almost any controller to FL Studio using the MIDI Scripting interface.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Currently this script is in beta. Don't expect many features, and don't expect it to work properly 100% of the time. 
That being said, I want to hear your feedback. What do you want to see in the script? What bugs have you found? How can I support your controller better?

### The easiest way to tell me these things is to join the Discord server.
