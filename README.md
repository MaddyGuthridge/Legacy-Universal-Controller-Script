# Universal-Controller-Script
A universal script to link almost any controller to FL Studio using the MIDI Scripting interface.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This is the legacy version of the script, which I don't intend to maintain any further. I am working on a complete rewrite that should make the script far more modular and easy to maintain, with the hope of making it the standard for most controllers. Currently, the new version doesn't work, but if you want to contribute, that's the one you should work on. Check it out [here](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Universal-Controller-Script).
