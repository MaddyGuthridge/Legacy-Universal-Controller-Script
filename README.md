# Universal-Controller-Script
A universal script to link almost any controller to FL Studio using the MIDI Scripting interface.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This is the legacy version of the script, which I don't intend to maintain any further. I am working on a complete rewrite that should make the script far more modular and easy to maintain, with the hope of making it the standard for most controllers. If you want to contribute, that's the one you should work on, unless you want to use an older version of FL Studio. Check the rewrite out [here](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Universal-Controller-Script)!

This code is still open source, so if you want to maintain it yourself, feel free. Just be warned that it is poorly designed and might be difficult to work with, especially compared to the new version.
